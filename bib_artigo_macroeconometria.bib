Using a proprietary software to download information directly from the Lattes platform it was possible to verify the profile and the tendencies of research in the area of Finance in the national territory. The main results of the study show that most of the researchers of Finance are relatively young with respect to their career, with PhD finished in between the years of 2005 and 2014, and located in the southeastern part of the country. The scientific output of Brazilian researchers in international journals is small in comparison to the total of publications. The number of published papers has risen exponentially, however the quality of the papers, measured by Qualis, has decreased. An analysis of the productivity of the researchers show that the most productive authors have two common attributes: PhD degree obtained in a foreign institution and the productivity scholarship from CNPQ.},

	abstract = {A complete set of statistical tools for beginning financial analysts from a leading authority Written by one of the leading experts on the topic, An Introduction to Analysis of Financial Data with R explores basic concepts of visualization of financial data. Through a fundamental balance between theory and applications, the book supplies readers with an accessible approach to financial econometric models and their applications to real-world empirical research. The author supplies a hands-on introduction to the analysis of financial data using the freely available R software package and case studies to illustrate actual implementations of the discussed methods. The book begins with the basics of financial data, discussing their summary statistics and related visualization methods. Subsequent chapters explore basic time series analysis and simple econometric models for business, finance, and economics as well as related topics including: Linear time series analysis, with coverage of exponential smoothing for forecasting and methods for model comparison Different approaches to calculating asset volatility and various volatility models High-frequency financial data and simple models for price changes, trading intensity, and realized volatility Quantitative methods for risk management, including value at risk and conditional value at risk Econometric and statistical methods for risk assessment based on extreme value theory and quantile regression Throughout the book, the visual nature of the topic is showcased through graphical representations in R, and two detailed case studies demonstrate the relevance of statistics in finance. A related website features additional data sets and R scripts so readers can create their own simulations and test their comprehension of the presented techniques. An Introduction to Analysis of Financial Data with R is an excellent book for introductory courses on time series and business statistics at the upper-undergraduate and graduate level. The book is also an excellent resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of business, finance, and economics who would like to enhance their understanding of financial data and today's financial markets.},

First, using five of the most actively traded stocks in the Brazilian financial market, this paper shows that the normality assumption commonly used in the risk management area to describe the distributions of returns standardized by volatilities is not compatible with volatilities estimated by EWMA or GARCH models. In sharp contrast, when the information contained in high frequency data is used to construct the realized volatility measures, we attain the normality of the standardized returns, giving promise of improvements in Value-at-Risk statistics. We also describe the distributions of volatilities of the Brazilian stocks, showing that they are nearly lognormal. Second, we estimate a simple model of the log of realized volatilities that differs from the ones in other studies. The main difference is that we do not find evidence of long memory. The estimated model is compared with commonly used alternatives in out-of-sample forecasting experiment.},

	title = {Estimating the {Volatility} of {Brazilian} {Equities} using {Garch}-{Type} {Models} and {High}-{Frequency} {Volatility} {Measures}},
	volume = {14},
	copyright = {Copyright/Copyright Transfer Policy  of Global Journals Publishing               This document supersedes all previous  statements of Global Journals' copyright and Authorization policies.  Authorization is granted to other publishers to adapt this policy for  your use with acknowledgement to Global Journals.       1. THE GLOBAL JOURNALS FOUNDATION     Global Journals is dedicated to authors for their fast publication process with best customer services.   The goal of Global Journals' publications program is to deliver quality  content and services at the lowest prices consistent with a vibrant and  fiscally healthy organization. Global Journals aims to serve readers'  and authors' interests by broadcasting high-quality original works,  maintaining the integrity of these works, shielding authors' rights in  them against plagiarism(copy-paste), providing a stable means of  relating to them, promoting the dissemination of these works to the  widest possible audience in modern media, and preserving access to them  forever despite changes in technology.     Global Journals  publication uses a double blind peer review process of selection,  editorial refinement, production, distribution and access, promotion,  indexing, interlinking, functional enhancement, user support, and  protection that requires the coordinated efforts of all participants in  the information chain, together with their support structures, and costs  a significant amount of money. Most of these costs exist regardless of  whether content is circulated in print or electronically (in terms of  Global Journals: Print Journals, eJournals, 3D Virtual Journals and  Interactive Journals). In order to derive sufficient revenue to support  the Global Journals' publishing process, Global Journals charges fees  for publication in Global Journals.    When readers access Global  Journals works through the Global Journals Digital Library, print  subscription, or other licensed distribution mechanism, they can be  assured that they are accessing the conclusive version of a work rather  than an early draft or a later unstudied version. They can be further  assured that the version they are accessing will be everlastingly  available.    Although Global Journals grants writers certain  rights to post author-prepared versions of their work covered by Global  Journals copyright, Global Journals requires that authors include the  Global Journals copyright declaration in these works, as well as a  reference to the definitive version in the Global Journals Digital  Library. By including the reference to the Global Journals Digital  Library, they alert readers to the availability of the conclusive  version of the work. Global Journals requires that users of Global  Journals copyrighted works in digital form access those works through  Global Journals, and not through alternative services which have not  been authorized/sanctioned by Global Journals to redistribute the works.    In exchange for the venue, the perceptibility, and services Global  Journals provides in publishing their work, authors grant Global  Journals the rights (privilege) to their work, which include the  exclusive privileges to sell subscriptions and access licenses to it.  Global Journals' bargain with authors and readers is reflected in the  Global Journals Copyright and Permissions Policies, the Rights and  Responsibilities in Global Journals Publishing and in the care invested  in making quality works readily accessible through sensible pricing and  tools that facilitate research uses. In the soul of this bargain, Global  Journals asks authors and readers alike to support Global Journals'  publishing platform by abiding by the Global Journals Copyright and  Permissions Policies.    Global Journals decisively considers that  it achieves a balance among divergent objectives; that its use of  copyright within its publishing program in fact aids the public good by  enabling the creation and widespread distribution of quality works in  various layouts and media.        2. COPYRIGHTED WORKS        2.1 Requirement for Copyright      Global Journals requires authors to assign their copyrights to Global  Journals as a condition of publishing the work. Copyright ownership  allows Global Journals to provide a feasible and sustainable Digital  Library to its fellows, associates and the public and to act against  unauthorized attempts to duplicate Global Journals' Digital Library.    Although some other publishers have approved licensing arrangements,  Global Journals relies on copyright transfer. Global Journals finds  copyright transfer more straightforward and easier to manage. In  licensing arrangements, all the specific acts for which permission is  sought must be foreseen and specified. A transfer with an explicit set  of author-retained rights is less probable to lead to false assumptions  about what the "owner" may do with the work after signing an exclusive  permissions license. Global Journals treats the transferred copyrights  as the basic means of gaining the right to publish; to create and  deliver the Digital Library; to further distribute works by acting as a  solo source for comprehensive republication requests, such as combined  collections or translations, and the delivery of the material to the  requesting party; to safeguard works from plagiarism and any other  illegal uses; and to sustain and develop its publishing program by  selling subscriptions or charging for access to its collections.    Global Journals requires that authors have the authority to transfer  copyright, or that they obtain the necessary authorization to implement  the transfer. Such transfer applies to any medium used by Global  Journals for publication. The Global Journals copyright transfer leaves  several important rights with the original owner.    Authors must  transfer copyright to Global Journals after getting Letter of  Acceptance. As per terms and conditions of Global Journals, in many  cases Global Journals automatically transfers copyright to itself, in  that case copyright transfer form filling is not required. This is  specified in your "Letter of Acceptance" that now your paper is  copyrighted to Global Journals or not.    Very soon after  acceptance, authors must incorporate the Global Journals copyright  notice and Global Journals citation of the publication into copies they  personally maintain on non-Global Journals servers.    The  author's copyright transfer applies only to the work as a whole, and not  to any embedded objects owned by third parties. An author who embeds an  object, such as an art image that is copyrighted by a third party, must  obtain that party's permission to include the object, with the  understanding that the complete work may be distributed as a unit in any  medium. The obligation to obtain third-party permission does not apply  if the author embeds only a link to the copyright holder's definitive  version of the object.    Authors who wish to embed a module of  another Global Journals-copyrighted work, e.g., an excerpt, a table, or a  figure, must obtain explicit permission from Global Journals.     In special cases where an author or author's employer must retain  copyright, or when Global Journals does not wish to give its imprimatur  to a specific work, Global Journals may accept a release from the owner  that grants Global Journals the permission it needs to publish the work.      2.2 Copyright Notice      The Global Journals copyright notice must be displayed on the first  page or initial screen of a display of all works copyrighted by Global  Journals, whether those works are published in print or in a digital  medium. It is acceptable to place the string "\&copy; Copyright 2001-2010 by  Global Journals USA" as a hypertext link to the full copyright notice in  digital media    COPYRIGHT NOTICE. Copyright \&copy; 2001-2010  by the Global Journals USA. Authorization to make digital or hard copies  of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted  without fee providing that copies are not made or distributed for profit  or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full  citation on the first page. Copyrights for components of this work owned  by others than Global Journals must be honored (credited by  referencing). Abstracting with credit is permitted. To republish, to  copy otherwise, to post on servers (or even webservers), or to  redistribute to lists, requires prior specific permission and/or some  fee.

You need JavaScript enabled to view it   for requests for permission and releases under this  policy. Persons granted permission to copy a Global Journals effort must  display with the copy  "\&copy; 20YY Global Journals, Inc. Included here by permission."         As  a matter of professional courtesy, the lead author of any Global  Journals copyrighted work is consulted in weighing requests from third  parties for permission to republish.      2.4 Conclusive Versions and Revisions      Global Journals will create and maintain a conclusive version of Global  Journals-copyrighted works. Global Journals preserves  bibliographic-reference Web pages for all works published in its Digital  Library. These pages, free and open to the public, contain the work's  bibliographic citation, abstract, indexing data, reviews, and links to  the conclusive version.     As part of their retained rights,  authors may revise their Global Journals-copyrighted work. If the new  work is substantially developed, it is considered a new derivative work.  The author preserves the copyright in the new work and may do as she  wishes with it. The author must incorporate a citation to the previous  work with a notice.   The suitable notice should appear both within the document and in the metadata associated with the document.   To differentiate between a new derivative work and a slight revision,  Global Journals uses, respectively, a rule of greater than or less than  20\% changed. Obviously, word counts are not an absolute measure. The  author is in the best position to judge when a work is merely revised or  offers a noteworthy new contribution.      2.5 Rights Retained by Authors and Original Copyright Holders      Under the Global Journals copyright transfer agreement, the original copyright holder retains:      The right to reuse any portion of the work, without fee, in future  works of the author's own*, including books, lectures and presentations  in all media, provided that the Global Journals citation and notice of  the Copyright are included   All extra proprietary rights to the work such as patent   The right to revise the work the right to post author-prepared  versions of the work covered by Global Journals copyright in a  individual gathering on their own Home Page and on a openly accessible  server of their employer, and in a repository legally mandated by the  organization funding the research on which the Work is based. Such  posting is limited to noncommercial access and individual use by others,  and must include this notice both embedded within the full text file  and in the supplementary citation display as well.        "\&copy; Global Journals, 20YY. This  is the author's version of the work. It is posted here by authorization  of Global Journals for your personal use. Not for redistribution. The  definitive version was published in PUBLICATION, \{Volume\#, Issue\#,  (DATE)\}  "     The right of an employer that originally owned copyright to  distribute definitive copies of its author-employees work within its  organization. Posting these works for world access requires explicit  permission from Global Journals.   Authors may post works on public repositories before acceptance but  must incorporate the Global Journals copyright notice upon transfer of  copyright.   After acceptance, authors may post the work on public repositories only with the explicit permission of Global Journals.   Reuse of third-party material contained in Global Journals  copyrighted works always requires the agreement of the copyright holder,  as Global Journals' copyright does not cover third-party material.   Requirements made on behalf of others, i.e., for contributions to  the work of other authors or other editors, may require payment of the  fee.        2.6 Fixity of Published Works      Global Journals does not alter works once published. There are times,  however, when it is appropriate to publish a revised or corrected  version of a work; doing so requires the approval of the responsible  editor. But this also can only be done in eJournal/e-version of  Journal/Magazine.       2.7 Solicited Works      From time to time, Global Journals solicits works for publication.  Examples are columns, invited works, award lectures, and keynote  speeches. Global Journals requests authors of such works not to  distribute copies or publish these works on their own Pages until Global  Journals has published them. Authors who wish to circulate before  publication must get permission from Global Journals. Global Journals  considers lectures and speeches to be published at the time they are  delivered.      2.8 Edited Collections      Edited collections like conference proceedings and newsletters are  copyrighted as a whole by Global Journals. In certain cases, such as  conference proceedings, the individual components are also copyrighted  by Global Journals. In other cases, particularly newsletters, copyrights  of some components will be retained by authors. In the second case,  Global Journals will obtain an authorization from each author that  permits publication in both print and online systems, and also grants  Global Journals the right to alter the work into any formats as needed  for use within the Global Journals Digital Library.    No Global  Journals-copyrighted collection may be displayed or published for open  distribution without prior authorization from Global Journals and  previously it has been included in the Global Journals Digital Library.  Accepted distributions must include a notice of this permission along  with the Global Journals copyright notice.      2.9 Coverage      The Global Journals copyright transfer declaration grants Global  Journals the right "to publish the work in complete or in part in any  and all media."       3. Global Journals Permissions / Authorizations Policy        3.1 Purposes/Objectives/Aims of this Policy      This policy sets out the liberal conditions under which Global Journals  grants authorization for copying or distribution, and the circumstances  under which Global Journals requires prior permission and/or a fee.    Global Journals has the succeeding goals in developing a complete permissions policy:      Aid classroom and other educational usage.   Spread awareness of works by indexing and abstracting them in many media.   Resolution of all requests for reuse promptly.   Simplicity in growth of value-added derivatives of Global Journals copyrighted works.   Professionally accomplish the process of applying copyright policy to specific authorization cases   Provision of hard-copy interlibrary loan.        3.2 General Permissions Policy      Global Journals grants free permission for individual digital or hard  copies made without fee for use in academic classrooms and for use by  individuals in individual research and study. No further reproduction or  distribution is allowed without clear permission from Global Journals.  All reproductions must carry the original citation, the Global Journals  copyright and notice of permission on the first page or initial screen  of the document or anything without exclusion.   Requestors may  expect a response to their inquiry within two business days. A  comprehensive reply may take longer, depending on the volume of requests  received and their complexity.      3.3 Educational and Library Uses of Copyrighted Works of Global Journals       Explanation  of classroom use: Copying and distributing single works by a  university/college lecturer, where no fee is charged to the students and  the distribution is limited to scholars enrolled in a  university/college course and their instructors.     Course Material  - Authorization granted without fee if the course material is produced  without charge to the student. (Realize commercially produced following  Course Packages.)    Distance Learning  -  Authorization granted without fee for distance learning students  enrolled at the institution. They have the same access rights to those  Global Journals copyrighted materials licensed by their organization as  any other student. Since official access is authenticated by IP address,  it is up to the organization to provide a proxy server for its remote  users, and to register the IP address of that proxy with Global  Journals.    Electronic Reserves  - Permission  granted without fee provided the library or institution has an  authentication mechanism for controlled access to the server and a  license to the Global Journals-copyrighted work. A school, college,  university or other accredited institution may place a single copy of a  conclusive version of the work in its library's electronic reserves for  the duration of its educational needs for that work, providing that  access is limited to its registered students (including those in its  distance learning programs), faculty, and staff. Those institutions  without a present license to the work should contact   permissions@globaljournals.org  This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it  .    Interlibrary Loan (ILL)  -  Authorization granted without fee for an organization with a Global  Journals Digital Library license to download and print works for  Interlibrary Loan. The Digital Library may be used as the source for the  printed copy.  Electronic dissemination is not allowed.    Walk-Ins  - Authorization granted without fee for access to all Global Journals  publications, print or electronic, by all members of the community which  a subscribing library is registered to serve.       3.4 Commercial Republication       Meaning of commercial republication: Any usage that is not individual  or non-profit educational use. Comprises reprinting by trade and  scholarly publishers, and use in business settings and their web sites  both internal and external. No direct profit need be realized from the  journal or sale of Global Journals material.       Commercial use requires all of the above terms and conditions, including  payment of a copyright release fee for non-exclusive, one-time use of  the work. Further uses in various media, succeeding editions and  translations need an additional authorization and fee is payable to  Global Journals.    All reproductions additional than those listed  above in "Educational Uses" require specific authorization and a fee to  be paid to Global Journals. This includes republishing in books, texts,  commercially-produced course packages, collections, and other edited  publications, and posting or other electronic distributions.    Commercially Produced Course Packages  - Use of copyrighted material in course packs requires an appropriate  license from the Global Journals. Requests received at Global Journals  HQ are referred to the CPCP.    Print authorization  - A grant of authorization involves discussion with the chief author of  the work, the publisher's agreement to pay the required fees, and  prominent display of the proper credit acknowledgment.    Electronic authorization  - Rules for commercial circulation will apply unless the request falls  under scholastic use as defined above. The term for internal and  external commercial posting of Global Journals copyrighted material is  usually limited to six months, but may be extended for an extra fee. All  postings must comprise pointers to the true Citation Page in the Global  Journals Digital Library.    Multiple copies  -  Producing multiple copies of Global Journals copyrighted works for  circulation to peers, clients, co-workers, etc. requires a transactional  license from the Global Journals and payment of the obligatory per copy  fee. Send requests to   permissions@globaljournals.org  This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it      Software     Software  published by Global Journals is subject to the Software License  Agreement (SLA). Commercial license for use of Global Journals  algorithms procedures, work etc. needs payment of a license fee, and a  small royalty payment if obligatory by the original author(s). Contact   permissions@globaljournals.org  This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it   for details. Sublicense Agreements needs extra fee and signature of sublicensee.       3.5 Fees      The fees for republishing full text works (or revised works) from  Global Journals publications are as follows. The fees mentioned are for  one-time use in a single medium. Several uses require extra fees. Fees  are subject to modification without prior notice.         Research   Work            Fee     \&nbsp;                Work current to 24 months old      \$230            Work more than 24 months old      \$110            Excerpt greater than 500   words       \$90            Excerpt less than 500 words      \$45            Figure or Table      \$30            Art designed by Global Journals      \$110            Freelance artwork      Painter determines fee            Software     \$550 flat fee + royalty negotiated   at author's demand                  3.6 Access to copyrighted research papers or works      Global Journals will hold its copyrighted works on its servers and  gives free and unrestricted authorization to create and copy links to  those works. Readers following links may freely browse metadata and  abstracts of the research work. Some journals of Global Journals are  open access while some are closed Access, where link to the full text of  the work/research paper is usually by license, subscription, or  transaction payment. An individual holding a copy may not duplicate that  copy or send it to others unless the copy carries explicit  authorization for additional replication or broadcasting.      3.7 Links      Global Journals treats HTML/CSS/Programmed/PDF/MS Word/Paper/Reference  links as citations (references to works/research papers) rather than as  incorporations (embedding of works/research papers). Permission is not  necessary to create links to citations in The Research Publications  Portal (Global Journals Digital Library or Online Guide to OJS  Literature). Global Journals inspires the widespread distribution of  links to the conclusive versions of its copyrighted works in the Global  Journals Digital Library and does not require that authors get prior  authorization to include such links in their new works/research papers.    However, someone who constructs a work/research papers or a service  whose pattern of links significantly duplicates a copyrighted work  should acquire prior authorization from the copyright holder. For  example: if the author of "A Table of Contents for the Latest Issue of  GJCST": comprising of citations and active links to author-versions of  the works in the latest issue of GJCST: requires Global Journals  authorization because that author is duplicating a Global  Journals-copyrighted effort. If all the links in the "Table of Contents"  pointed to the Global Journals-held conclusive versions, Global  Journals would usually give permission because then the new work  promotes a Global Journals work/research papers. To avoid confusions,  consult with Global Journals before duplicating a Global Journals work  through links.    If an author requires embedding a copyrighted  object, instead of a link, in a new work, that author needs to get the  copyright holder's authorization.      3.8 Distributions/Services by non-Global Journals Servers    Distributions and Service Providers  Service providers do not essentially requires to get prior  authorization from Global Journals to locate and distribute links to the  Global Journals-held conclusive versions of works, but they do need  authorization if they are making, collecting, or distributing copies of  Global Journals-copyrighted works/research papers.     Electronic Access and Public Repositories    Although most of the journals are open access, Journals which have  closed Access to the full text of Global Journals works is by  subscription through the Global Journals Research Publications Portal  and Digital Library. Metadata for the work/research paper, index terms,  abstracts, reviews, references, including citations, the citing works,  and comments, are all accessible to the general public through the  Global Journals Digital Library or Global Journals Research Publications  Portal.    Global Journals is open to needs for authorization to  post Global Journals copyrighted works to pre-publication servers for  the purpose of early distribution. Global Journals does not usually  grant authorization to post Global Journals copyrighted works on other  servers acting as public repositories that compete with the Global  Journals Digital Library.    Individuals often allocate copies of  works authored by themselves or by others. Distribution may comprise of  sending copies to a mailing list or of posting a copy on a server where  it is accessible to others who might copy it. Such electronic  circulations and postings of Global Journals-copyrighted works are acts  of copying and needs Global Journals authorization, unless explicitly  allowed under other provisions of this policy. When in uncertainty,  please email us at   permissions@globaljournals.org  This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it  .    Authors, co-authors, students and their  employers who have transferred copyright to Global Journals may post  author-prepared versions of their research paper/works and revisions as  specified in this whole policy.    Everybody who legally obtains a  copy of a Global Journals-copyrighted work may use the copy only for  non-commercial, personal or classroom use, as stated in the Global  Journals copyright notice, unless further authorization has been granted  by Global Journals.      3.9 Production of Digitized Copies    Individuals who have authorization under these policies to make copies  may elect to digitize a print copy and to allocate the digitized copy.  Since digitizing processes such as OCR (optical character recognition)  are error-prone, this disclaimer must be included with the Global  Journals copyright notice on each digitized copy:    This is a  digitized reproduction derived from a Global Journals-copyrighted  research paper/work. Global Journals did not prepare this reproduction  and does not guarantee that it is an accurate reproduction of the  originally published research paper/work.                 4. PROCESSES       Global Journals has set great standards for all aspects of the publishing procedure.      Simultaneous Submission      The Global Journals does not usually permit manuscripts under review  (By "under review" we mean a manuscript that has been submitted, and has  not been either rejected or withdrawn) in its journals or conference  proceedings to be concurrently under review for another publication. The  only exceptions to the prohibition in contradiction of simultaneous  submission are cases where an individual Global Journals publication  unambiguously states that such submissions are permissible in its  Instructions for Calls for Papers, Authors, and other appropriate public  forums. For illustration, in some cases, conferences may precisely  approve simultaneous submission of identical papers to related  conferences with overlapping submission periods. Under no circumstances  shall a paper (or considerably the similar paper) be  simultaneously/concurrently submitted to two or more publications, or to  a second publication while still under review elsewhere, without a  letter of notification to the Editor-in-Chief, Dean or Program Chair of  each affected publication. Disappointment to obey to this policy will be  a cause for rejection of the manuscript. Repeated abuses may lead to a  ban on future submissions at the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief, Dean  or Program Chair.     Prior Publication     The contributions appearing in Global Journals magazines, journals and  conference proceedings are usually original papers that have not been  previously published in a non-refereed, refereed or formally reviewed  publication. Distributing the paper as a report, posting the research  paper on a website, or presenting the paper at a workshop or conference  that does not publish formally reviewed proceedings does not prohibit it  from appearing in a Global Journals publication. Workshops and  conferences are encouraged to specify in their calls for papers whether  or not they will publish officially reviewed proceedings so that authors  can determine whether or not submission will risk Global Journals  publication.      Authors may submit to Global Journals conferences  and journals revised versions of papers that appeared previously in  non-refereed, refereed or formally reviewed publications or under  consideration for such publication elsewhere if:   The paper has been considerably revised (this  generally means that at least 30\% of the paper is material not  previously published; however, this is a rather subjective requirement  that is left up to each publication to understand);   The published policies of the publications or  conferences involved do not prohibit this. The corresponding author  signs for and accepts responsibility for publishing any material on  behalf of any and all co-authors. This contract is to be signed by at  least one of the authors who have acquired the agreement of the  co-author(s) where applicable.  Upon submission, the author notifies the  Editor-in-Chief, Dean or Program Chair that the paper has been  previously published or simultaneously submitted; and   Editor-in-Chief, Dean or Program Chair have  considerable discretion in determining if special conditions permit  republication of a paper. In some cases, conferences may precisely  approve simultaneous submission of identical/similar papers to related  conferences with overlapping submission periods. Also, some journals may  call papers from certain conferences for special journal issues. This  may lead to acceptance without significant revision. Editor-in-Chief,  Dean or Program Chair may permit republication of papers without  significant revision under other special circumstances as well, for  illustration, republication of a historically significant paper as part  of a reviewing. In any circumstance where a paper is republished without  significant revision, any prior publication should be noted on the  title page of the paper. Clear authorization must be obtained from the  copyright holder before papers not copyrighted by Global Journals and  may be republished.},

	abstract = {Financial markets require an accurate estimate of asset volatility for various purposes such as risk management, decision-making and portfolio selection. Moreover, for risk management, volatility estimation is critical in Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculation models. However, there is still no consensus on a model that performs best in estimating volatility. This study proposes comparing volatility measures based on high-frequency data, such as RV and RRV, with heteroskedastic volatility models that use squared daily returns and daily closing prices. Four GARCH type models were implemented to estimate heteroskedastic volatility for the two most actively traded shares on the Brazilian stock exchange, using skewed generalized t (SGT) distribution and allowing flexibility for modeling the empirical distribution of these asymmetric financial data. Performed tests indicated no differential between the GARCH models and the high-frequency volatility measures used to estimate the VaR, indicating that both measures could be utilized for risk management purposes.},

investigate how the specification of a distribution influences the performance of volatility forecasting on Ibovespa intraday data, using the APARCH model. The forecasts were carried
out assuming six distinct distributions: normal, skewed normal, t-student, skewed t-student, generalized and skewed generalized. The results evidence that the model considering the skewed t-student distribution offered the best fit to the data inside the sample, on the other hand, the model assuming a normal distribution provided a better out-of-the-sample performance forecast.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to examine whether investors who trade daily but at different times have distinct perceptions about the risk of an asset. In order to capture the uncertainty faced by these investors, we define the volatility perceived by investors as the distribution of standard deviations of daily returns calculated from intraday prices collected randomly. We find that this distribution has a high degree of dispersion. This means that different investors may not share the same opinion regarding the variability of returns of the same asset. Moreover, the close-to-close volatility is often less than the median of the volatility distribution perceived by investors while the open-to-open volatility is greater than that statistic. From a practical point of view, our results indicate that volatilities estimated using traditional samples of daily returns (i.e., close-to-close and open-to-open returns) may not do a good job when used as inputs in financial models since they may not properly capture the risk investors are exposed.},

	abstract = {In this paper we compare several multi-period volatility forecasting models, specifically from MIDAS and HAR families. We perform our comparisons in terms of out-of-sample volatility forecasting accuracy. We also consider combinations of the models' forecasts. Using intra-daily returns of the BOVESPA index, we calculate volatility measures such as realized variance, realized power variation and realized bipower variation to be used as regressors in both models. Further, we use a nonparametric procedure for separately measuring the continuous sample path variation and the discontinuous jump part of the quadratic variation process. Thus MIDAS and HAR specifications with the continuous sample path and jump variability measures as separate regressors are estimated. Our results in terms of mean squared error suggest that regressors involving volatility measures which are robust to jumps (i.e. realized bipower variation and realized power variation) are better at forecasting future volatility. However, we find that, in general, the forecasts based on these regressors are not statistically different from those based on realized variance (the benchmark regressor). Moreover, we find that, in general, the relative forecasting performances of the three approaches (i.e. MIDAS, HAR and forecast combinations) are statistically equivalent.
